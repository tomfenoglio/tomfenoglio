- <b>React Static Developer Portfolio</b>

- <b>Django API for a restaurant</b>
  - This is my final project of the APIs course of the [Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer)  using Django and DRF. Its a fully functioning API project for a restaurant, so that the client application developers can use the APIs to develop web and mobile applications. People with different roles will be able to browse, add and edit menu items, place orders, browse orders, assign delivery crew to orders and finally deliver the orders. [Repository](https://github.com/tomfenoglio/django-api-littlelemon.git)
- <b>Django fullstack app for restaurant</b>
  - This was my final project for the "The Full Stack" course of the [Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer)  using Django for both the front-end and back-end. Table reservations can be made through the website and are stored in the MySQL database. The page renders and does not allow you to reselect schedules already reserved. The "reservations" tab renders a JSON with all the reservations already made. The information on menu items is managed through Django admin, since they come from a MySQL table. [Repository](https://github.com/tomfenoglio/fullstack-final-project.git)
- <b>entradaselectronicas.com</b>
  - This is a project in current development. It is a platform where different user profiles can create events, sell, buy and transfer tickets for shows. The goal is that in a few months it will be fully functional and in service to the public.
    - The frontend is being developed using React and Next.js. [Repository](https://github.com/tomfenoglio/entradaselectronicas-frontend.git)
    - The backend is being developed using Django and MySQL. [Repository](https://github.com/tomfenoglio/entradaselectronicas-backend.git)
